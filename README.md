# Dotfiles

This repo contains my Linux dotfiles. I use it to setup ArchLinux/Manjaro
and Debian/Ubuntu machines the way I want it. Assumes you either use Sway
on Wayland or i3 on x.org and bash as your main shell.

I use [Yet-Another-Dotfiles-Manager 
(YADM)](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/) to manage dotfiles. Once
you've installed yadm, a clone will initialize the homedir.

    $ yadm clone https://github.com/blastur/dotfiles.git
